# Películas URJC 2019

Welcome to our app.

4º GITT & GITT+IAA future engineers from URJC inverted their time and efforts to
bring this app to life.

This app tries to provide users with useful functionalities that work over films datasets.

The users are able to select diferent types of filters or formats to recive the informaton.

We used the programming language Java with the Sparkjava framework as the web
 aplication manager, travis-ci for testing and deployments, and an herokuapp for
  hosting. We integreted the datasets via database with postgresql.

We have plenty of documentation in Spanish on our wiki.
